Simple API for building cool blogs

## :mag: Overview
This API provides the ability to create simple blogs with markdown markup based on an already created system of posts and comments. For convenient blogging, there is an administrator authorization service with a set of secure routes. The comments service does not require registration, but all comments can be verified by administrators.
